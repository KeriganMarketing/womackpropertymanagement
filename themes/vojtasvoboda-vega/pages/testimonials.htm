<p>&ldquo;Patti has been managing our Gulf, Mobile and Ohio (GM&amp;O). a&nbsp;Historic Building in Mobile, Alabama for the past few years. Ms. Womack has done an excellent job of handling the many difficulties that occur in a 60.000 square foot Historic Building. She has helped us in&nbsp;keeping our costs at or below budget. She has been able to manage several emergencies and is on call for us 24/7. On many occasions we have received compliments from our tenants for both Patti&rsquo;s service and her easy going demeanor. We would highly recommend Patti and her company for Property Management Services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As an investor in real estate, I have had the privilege to work with Patti Womack on the management of our townhome project.&nbsp; Throughout her management tenure, she has exhibited only the highest of standards in her business dealings.&nbsp; She always went the extra mile to ensure that she knew everything about a property and was eager to do whatever was necessary to improve our property and make it a financially productive investment.&nbsp;Her hard work and motivation to excel to the highest standard is remarkable and greatly appreciated by all those who have had the opportunity to do business with her.</p>
<p>Patti's hard work and motivation to do excellent work shows a great work ethic and strong determination which I find rare in today&rsquo;s world.&nbsp; If all my associates were of the caliber of Patti Womack, I would be immensely blessed.&nbsp; I therefore, highly encourage you to consider Patti and her team for your investment property needs.&nbsp; She will be a great asset in any enterprise which she undertakes and will be an effective advocate for the property owners whom she represents.&rdquo;</p>
